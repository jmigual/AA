The \texttt{Set Packing Problem} is defined as follows: Given a family of sets $S_1,...,S_m \subseteq U$ such that, $\forall i \ 1 \le i \le m,\ |S_i|=3$ and has profit $c(S_i)$, find a subset of these sets that maximizes the profit, while each element is covered at most once. Consider a straightforward integer linear programming formulation of the problem:

$$
\max \sum_{i=1}^m c(S_i)x_i
$$
$$
\sum_{i|u\in S_i} x_i \le 1 \quad \forall u \in U
$$
$$
x_i \in {0, 1} \quad 1 \le i \le m
$$

Consider the following algorithm that, first computes an optimal solution $x^*$ of the LP obtained by relaxing $x_i \in [0, 1]$, and second performs the following rounding algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Chose a set $S_i$ to be in the solution with probability $\frac{x_i^*}{6}$
	\item If an element $u\in U$ is covered by more than one set, remove all the sets in the solution that contain $u$.
\end{enumerate}

Show that the proposed algorithm is a randomized 12-approximation for \texttt{Set packing}

\textbf{Solution:}


\begin{gather*}
	x_i \in [0,1] \\
	x_i^* = P(x_{i,opt} = 1) \\
	P(x_i^1 = 1) = \frac{x_i^*}{6} = \frac{P(x_{i,opt} = 1)}{6} \\
\end{gather*}
\begin{gather*}
	P(x_i = 1) = P(x_i^1 = 1) \cdot P(x_i^2 = 1) = \frac{1}{12}
\end{gather*}
